# ctherm_tsacch_coculture
Repository for the coculture model of C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum, modeled using SteadyCom

06/17/2022: This repository contains ONLY the model files for C. thermocellum (iCTH669) and T. saccharolyticum models (iTSA525) models in their community (e.g. allowed mutualism) and non-community (e.g. enforced neutralism) forms and a single script for running a single SteadyCom simulation of the community. The manuscript is currently under preparation. Additional codes, model versions, and data will be made available upon direct request to Wheaton Schroeder at wls5190@psu.edu or when the manuscript is submitted for publication.
